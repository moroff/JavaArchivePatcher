# JavaArchivePatcher

The goal of this project is to provide utilities to handle java archives (jar, ear or war). List, search or replace resouce
files or java class files.

# Requirements

For unit testing jar/war/ear samples are required. I used them from the github repository https://github.com/Yavin/maven-ear-example 
and build it prior building me stuff.
